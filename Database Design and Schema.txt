2. Database Design and Schema

Phase 2 tasked us with crafting a comprehensive chart, known as an Entity-Relationship
Diagram (ERD), to map out how our data is structured for our client—a travel expert agency.
This involved meticulously illustrating the relationships between various data points within our
tables and specifying the rules governing each piece of information.
Furthermore, we were required to develop a simplified version of this chart, referred to as a
Table Instances Chart (TIC), tailored specifically to the needs of our client company, a travel
expert agency. This streamlined model aimed to streamline their understanding of our data
structure, facilitating smoother operations and decision-making within their organization.

2.1 X:X Relationships

1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
Each product in the "Product" table has exactly one description.
Each region in the "Region" table has exactly one description.

2. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationships:
Each supplier in the "Supplier" table can supply multiple products, but each product is supplied
by only one supplier.
Each company in the "Company" table can have multiple addresses, but each address belongs to
only one company.
Each location in the "Location" table belongs to one region, but each region can have multiple
locations.
Each customer in the "Customer" table has one address, but each address can be associated with
multiple customers.
Each itinerary in the "Itinerary" table can be related to multiple commissions, but each
commission is related to only one itinerary.

3. Many-to-Many (N:M) Relationships:
Each itinerary in the "Itinerary" table can be connected to multiple trip types, and each trip type can
be associated with multiple itineraries.
Each transaction in the "Transaction" table can involve multiple payments, and each payment can
be part of multiple transactions.
